# ML4ITS.github.io

This is the repository for the https://ML4ITS.github.io website.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The website is a static page hosted using GitHub-pages.
The files for the page can be found in [/docs].
We use Jekyll to generate HTML, which will appear in the `/docs/_site` directory (generated by GitHub when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch).

### Local development

We use docker for local development.
Make sure you have docker installed and running on your machine.
Then:

* `make build` (first time only)
* `make run`

You should now have a local copy of the website hosted at http://localhost:4000.
Now, any changes made to the files should update the local website.

## How to create a new page

Creating a new page is easy.
Simply create a new markdown file in the [docs/_pages](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/docs/_pages/) directory.
Start by copying one of the existing files, for instance [research.md](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/docs/_pages/research.md):
`cp docs/_pages/research.md docs/_pages/research2.md`
Now, edit the `permalink` attribute of `docs/_pages/research2.md`:
```
---
title: "ML4ITS - Research"
layout: textlay
excerpt: "ML4ITS -- Research"
sitemap: false
permalink: /research2/
---
```
The new page should now be available at http://localhost:4000/research2.
